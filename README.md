# Data Warehouse With Amazon Redshift and Visualizing Redshift data using Power BI


## Introduction

A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As their data engineer, you are tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights into what songs their users are listening to.

## Project Dataset

There are two datasets that reside in S3:

    Song data: s3://udacity-dend/song_data
    Log data: s3://udacity-dend/log_data

Log data json path: s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json
### Song Dataset

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.

    song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
    song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json

### Log Dataset

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

    log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
    log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json


## Project Files

    create_tables.py: Creating the fact and dimension tables for the star schema in Redshift.
    etl.py: Is where will load data from S3 into staging tables on Redshift and then process that data into your analytics tables on Redshift.
    sql_queries.py: Contains all sql queries, and is imported into the two files above.
    dwh.cfg: Conatians Redshift database and IAM Role info.
    create_aws.ipynb: Contains commands to create the IAM role and Redshift cluster.
    README.md: provides discussion on the project.

## Database Schema Design

Staging Tables:

    staging_event: for log data.
    staging_song: for song data.

Fact Table:

    songplays: records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong -songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

Dimension Tables

    users - users in the app -user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
    songs - songs in music database -song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
    artists - artists in music database -artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude
    time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units -start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday
    
    
## ETL Pipeline

The ETL Pipeline consists of 2 steps:

    Load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift.
    Execute SQL statements in sql_queries.py that create the analytics tables from these staging tables.

First, I will extract data from S3 and staging them in Redshift using COPY Command. The staging tables are: staging_event & staging_song. Transform data into a set of dimensional tables and fact table with Star Schema. Then, load data from staging tables to analytics tables on Redshift with INSERT INTO statment. To avoid duplication data, use SELECT DISTINCT.


## How to run the Python Scripts
To create tables

    Run create_tables.py to create your database and tables. python create_tables.py

To run ETL pipeline

    Run etl.py, Remember to run create_tables.py before running etl.py. python etl.py
    
## Visualizing Redshift data with Power BI

Connect Power BI to Redshift to create dashboard:

    To connect to an Amazon Redshift database, select Get data > Database > Amazon Redshift.
    In the Amazon Redshift window that appears, type your Amazon Redshift Server and Database.
    Then put in your username and password.
    Once you successfully connect, click load > Import.
    Build your Dashboard.
